# polysticky.js
A position sticky polyfill that doesn't suck.

## Introduction

This library was born with a simple goal in mind: provide a `position: sticky` polyfill for browsers that do no support it, written with clean code in mind, using Object Oriented Programming.

Say hello to polysticky.js.

## Feature set

### OOP

The library is written with Class oriented development in mind. This means it's very easy to extend, and focus on the single use-case.

### Top/Bottom support

This polyfill supports `top` or `bottom` positioning. In the future will be extended with `left` and `right`.

### UMD Ready

You can use this library in the environment you prefer, thanks to the UMD bundling provided by WebPack.
